      <t>The DANE TLSA protocol <xref target="RFC6698" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7671" format="default"/>
      describes how to publish Transport Layer Security (TLS) server
      certificates or public keys in the DNS. This document updates RFC
      6698 and RFC 7671.
      It describes how to use the TLSA record to enable certificate 
      discovery for object security use cases, and how to use PKIX 
      validation for TLSA records queried without the benefit of 
      DNSSEC.

      <name>Introduction and Motivation</name>
      <t>
	A digital identity is comprised of at least two essential elements:
    a name, and a method for proving ownership of the name. Digital identities 
    are often represented using <xref target="RFC5280" format="default">X.509 certificates</xref>,
    which bind a name to a public key under a certificate authority's 
    signature. This allows all entities which trust the certificate authority 
    to trust that the public key associated with the name in the certificate
    is authentic and unaltered. The public key may be used to establish a secure 
    session between two entities using a protocol like TLS or DTLS. The 
    public key in the certificate may also be used to provide object security mechanisms like 
    cryptographic signatures or payload encryption. The certificate discovery process 
    for object security usually relies on either the gratuitous transmission of the 
    certificate by the entity (IEEE 802.11p), or the use of a proprietary API presented
    by the certificate authority.
      </t>
      <t>
      Internet of Things (IoT) applications increasingly need to authenticate messages 
      sent through decoupled applications. Without some sort of message security mechanism
      in place, trust in sender identity is assumed based on the trustworthiness of all 
      systems and networks involved in handling the message between 
      the sending entity and the recipient.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document proposes the use of the DANE TLSA record for certificate discovery,
    and provides an optional method for certificate authentication, in the event DNSSEC 
    is not available.
      </t>

    <section anchor="owner_format" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Associating Sender and Recipient Identities in TLSA Records</name>
      <t>
        This document defines a specific label or DNS naming format 
        for the TLSA DNS records which carry entity certificates, and 
        this format is compatible with the DANE_CLIENT_CERTS_DRAFT. This
        is necessary to provide a well-known location for securely 
        retrieving a CA certificate which can be used to verify 
        certificates retrieved from DNS without the benefit of 
        DNSSEC.
      </t>

     

    <section anchor="auth_model" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Authentication Model</name>
      <t>
	The authentication model assumed in this document is the following:
      </t>
      <t>
	The entity which generates the cryptographic signature for the 
    message or object has an associated name in DNS where the 
    certificate bearing the public key which can be used to 
    authenticate the signature and message or object can be retrieved.
    </t>
    <t>
    Likewise, an entity which can receive messages encrypted using a 
    public key (aither directly, or by way of a key-wrapping technique)
    has a DNS-based identity where a public key suitable for message 
    encryption can be found.
    </t>
    <t>
	DNSSEC SHOULD be used to ensure the integrity of the certificate
    presented via the TLSA record. For a variety of reasons, DNSSEC 
    is not ubiquitous across the entire DNS namespace. For zones 
    which are not protected by DNSSEC, the CA certificate which can
    be used to verify the certificates presented by the TLSA records 
    MUST be located at https://authority._device.DOMAIN/ca.pem. The 
    TLS server certificate presetnted MUST be signed by a browser-recognized CA,
    The certificates in the ca.pem file do not need to 
    chain to a known CA. Trust is established in those certificates 
    by virtue of being presented over a server-authenticated session 
    using an browser-verified certificate obtained by the owning organization.
      </t>
      <t>
      The method of certificate discovery via TLSA records, without DNSSEC, 
      shall be referred to as PKIX-CD, and shall use the DANE Certificate Usage
      value of 4, which indicates that the party requesting the certificate is 
      responsible for validating it using the ca.pem file stored at the 
      known location https://authority._device.DOMAIN/ca.pem.
      </t>
      <t>
    The ca.pem file must contain the CA certificate (or certificates) 
    which can be used to directly verify every certificate presented 
    beneath _device.DOMAIN.
      </t>
      <t>
    The certificates presented without the benefit of DNSSEC MUST 
    contain the SubjectAlternativeName OID, with one DNSName 
    which exactly matches the DNS name used to retrieve the certificate. A 
    certificate which is delivered without the benefit of DNSSEC,
    even if the CA's signature is valid, MUST not be trusted without 
    alignment between the DNS name used to retrieve the certificate 
    and one DNSName attribute within the certificate. The 
    SubjectAlternativeName field may have other entries in addition 
    to the one which aligns with the DNS name where the certificate 
    can be discovered.

	This document updates RFC 6698 by defining the use of the TLSA
        record for client TLS certificates. There are no security
        considerations for this document beyond those described
	in RFC 6698 and RFC 7671 and in the specifications for TLS and
        DTLS [RFC8446], [RFC5246], [RFC6347].
